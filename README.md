# EthioVerifyPay - Payment Verification API 🛡️

A robust Node.js/Express backend designed to eliminate payment fraud and manual entry errors in the Ethiopian merchant ecosystem (Telebirr/CBE).

## 🚀 The Challenge
Merchants in Ethiopia frequently face:
1. **Manual Entry Errors:** Customers sending money to the wrong merchant account due to typos in USSD codes.

## 🛠️ System Architecture
The API acts as a secure verification layer that:
- Generates **unique merchant verification codes** to prevent spoofing.
- Constructs **URL-encoded USSD strings** (e.g., `*127*1*...%23`) that interface directly with mobile dialers.

## ⚙️ Technical Highlights
- **Environment Management:** Securely handles MongoDB Atlas connections and API keys via `.env`.
- **CORS Security:** Configured to allow only trusted frontend origins, protecting the verification flow.
- **Error Handling:** Centralized middleware to handle database connection failures and invalid merchant lookups.

## 📦 Tech Stack
- **Runtime:** Node.js
- **Framework:** Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB Atlas (Mongoose ODM)
- **Deployment:** Render (with auto-sleep prevention logic)

## 🏗️ Local Setup
1. `git clone https://github.com/Ekram2004/payment-verify-backend`
2. `npm install`
3. Create `.env` with `MONGODB_URI` and `PORT`.
4. `npm start`
